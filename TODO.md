# TODO

- [x] in Gibbs, `Output` should be `(List[Substate1], List[Substate2], ...)`
- [ ] Maybe use traits for the `Substate`'s...
- [ ] Get rid of `scala-distributions` dependency. Use `commons.math3` with my extensions instead. 
     `scala-distributions` was a very valuable exercise. Just too hard too debug as a one-man project.
